A VB/VBA Library for reading/writing intrinsic types at arbitrary memory addresses. 
Its defining feature is that this is achieved using truly native, built-in language features. 
It uses no API declarations and has no external dependencies. 

01/07/26 NOTE: In its current form, this project crashes when using "Compile On Demand". Working on a fix.

12/31/25 New method for VBA/p-code applications. Should meet the theoretical performance limit for native procedures.
